By the morning of the next day three people had died, while 12 were wounded, eight severely. At midday, six of the wounded were in a critical state. The shooter left the area by taxi and remains at large.\n\nBackground\nThe Christkindelsmärik is the Christmas market in Strasbourg, held annually on the square in front of the Strasbourg Cathedral since 1570. In 2000, a bombing plot was foiled by the French and German police: the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat had planned to detonate pressure cookers rigged as homemade bombs in the crowd at the Christkindelsmärik. Since then, the market has been under reinforced security, and subject of several suspected or actual attack attempts. In 2016, when several people were arrested in Marseille and Strasbourg for preparing a terrorist attack, cancelling the Christmas market was considered, although it was ultimately held as scheduled.\n\nOn the morning of 11 December 2018, the police raided the home of the suspect in Neudorf; he was not home, but the police found a fragmentation grenade, a loaded .22 long rifle, four knives (including two hunting knives) and ammunition in his apartment. The police had also been attempting to arrest him on suspicion of murder at this time.\n\nIncident\nThe incident started at around 19:50 local time (18:50 GMT), near Place Kléber, where the Christkindelsmärik was being held. The shooter, identified as Chérif Chekatt, entered the area through Pont du Corbeau, then went through Rue des Orfèvres, opening fire in three different locations, first at Carré-d'Or (rue des Orfèvres), then rue des Grandes-Arcades. The shooting lasted for ten minutes across multiple streets, during which time Chekatt was heard crying \"Allahu Akbar\" as he shot at the crowd. He then exchanged fire with soldiers of Opération Sentinelle, and then of the National Police; a soldier was hit in the hand, and Chekatt was himself shot in the arm.  A 45-year old Thai tourist was hit in the head in front of a restaurant and died, despite passersby attempting to resuscitate him - ambulances took over 45 minutes to arrive. The shooter then escaped in direction of Neudorf and Place de l'Étoile, taking a taxi cab; the driver was unharmed and reported to the police having taken an armed and wounded man. His testimony allowed the police to identify the gunman.\n\nThe incident led to the closure of locations around the city including the European Parliament building. Police used Twitter to relay information to the public. The shooter remains at large, with 350 men of the security forces (RAID, BRI and Sentinelle) hunting for him, supported by air units.\n\nThe French government raised their security threat level to the highest possible as the search for the gunman continued, although Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet stated on Public Sénat that a state of emergency would not be declared for the occasion. Five thousand people were stranded in a sports facility used as temporary shelter, and the European Parliament was put on lockdown. Its President, Antonio Tajani, tweeted that \"[the European Parliament] will not be intimidated by terrorist or criminal attacks [and will] continue to work and react, strengthened by freedom and democracy against terrorist violence.\"\n\nThe incident was declared an act of terrorism by French authorities.\n\nVictims\n\nThe shooter entered the Old town of Strasbourg on Rue du Vieux Marché aux Poissons, coming from Pont du Corbeau (picture from Christmas 2014)\nThree people were killed at the scene while 12 others were injured, 6 in critical condition. The dead were identified as a 45-year old male tourist from Thailand who was on holiday with his wife, a man from Strasbourg born in 1957 (age 60 or 61), and a man from Afghanistan who has been left brain-dead.\n\nAt least two of the injured were attached to the European Parliament: an Italian journalist from Europhonica who was part of the press packet for the sitting, and a French staffer. One of the soldiers who was involved in the shoot-out with Chekatt was injured.\n\nSuspect\nThe suspect, 29-year-old Strasbourg-born man of Moroccan heritage, Chérif Chekatt, was known to the security services in France, Germany and Switzerland for 27 petty crimes. After his release from prison in France in 2015, he received a prison sentence for theft in Singen, Germany, and was expelled to France after his release in 2017.\n\nHe was tagged with a fiche \"S\" (\"State Security\" file), a type of extra-judiciary document that French State security uses to keep trace of suspect individuals, for his recent \"religious radicalisation\". Neighbours note that whilst they believed Chekatt's older brother was a radicalised Muslim, he himself seemed quite ordinary. Laurent Nuñez, Secretary of State to the Interior Minister, explicitly stated that the suspect was known to have a terrorist character, but that whilst he became a terrorism apologist in prison was not expected to perform an attack. On the morning of the attack, local police attempted to arrest him in relation to another murder, but could not locate him at this time.\n\nAn investigation has been started for \"murder and acts of terrorism in relation to a criminal enterprise\". Four people close to the suspect were detained for questioning after the shooting.\n\nReactions\nPresident of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel reacted the same day on Twitter, expressing condolences; Juncker called Strasbourg \"a city of symbol of European peace and democracy\" and Bettel, a \"symbol of European values\". British Prime Minister Theresa May said that her \"thoughts are with all of those affected and with the French people\".\n\nThe French national security was raised to its highest, and border controls were increased due to Strasbourg's proximity to Germany. The Christmas market was closed on the day after the attack.\n\nSee also\n2016 Nice truck attack\nNovember 2015 Paris attacks\nStrasbourg Cathedral bombing plot\n", "date": "2018-12-12"}}

The Life.ru news portal was reported to have obtained a recording of the last words of one of the pilots: \"Commander, we are going down.\" There was no official confirmation.\n\nOn 29 December it was announced by the Flight Safety Service of the Russian Ministry that a preliminary analysis of data from the cockpit voice recorder showed that no explosion had occurred on board.\n\nOn 16 January the Interstate Aviation Committee, the civil authority in aviation accident investigation, has announced that its representative would participate in the investigation.\n\nOn 19 January Interfax reported that, during underwater search for the Tu-154 fragments, remains had also been found of a Soviet Douglas A-20 Havoc/DB-7 Boston bomber, supplied from the US through the Lend-Lease agreement, which crashed on 15 November 1942.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, Russia's Kommersant said all the evidence pointed to the pilot, Maj Roman Volkov having suffered from somatogravic illusion. Analysis of the flight data suggested that the pilot had \"lost his bearings and ignored his instruments, believing that the jet was climbing too sharply.\" Tiredness was thought to be a factor. Experts said that he was already feeling unwell on the ground and had trouble getting the plane on to the correct runway. ", "date": "2018-03-24"}}

Given the shallow depth of the quake and its proximity to North Korea's primary nuclear weapons testing facility, experts concluded that the country had conducted a sixth nuclear weapon test since the country first exploded a nuclear device in 2006. North Korea claimed that they had tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being mounted on an ICBM. The independent seismic monitoring agency NORSAR estimated that the blast had a yield of around 120 kilotons. An official KCNA statement of 3 September, also claimed North Korea’s ability to conduct a “super-powerful EMP attack”.\n\nOn the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis speaking on behalf of the White House, warned there would be \"a massive military response\" to any threat from North Korea against the United States, including Guam, or its allies.\n\nEarly on 4 September, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) conducted a ballistic missile exercise that involved the South's Hyunmoo ballistic missile and the F-15K fighter jets, which was billed to be in response to North's detonation. The state news agency Yonhap said the South's military had carried out a live-fire exercise simulating an attack on the North's nuclear site, hitting \"designated targets in the East Sea\".\n\nOn the same day, the UN Security Council convened to discuss further measures against North Korea; the leaked draft the relevant UNSC resolution prepared by the U.S. was said to call for an oil embargo on North Korea, ban on the country's exports of textiles, on the hiring of North Korean workers abroad as well as personal sanctions against Kim Jong-un. Despite resistance from China and Russia, the United States on 8 September formally requested a vote of the United Nations Security Council on the U.S. resolution. UNSC 2375 passed on 11 September as a significantly watered-down version of the United States' request.\n\nOn 6 September, Donald Trump, after a telephone conversation with China′s Xi Jinping, said that the United States would not tolerate North Korea′s provocations, although military action was not his \"first choice\".\n\nMissile test over Japan on 15 September\nOn 14 September, North Korea issued a threat to \"sink\" Japan, and turn the US to \"ashes and darkness\". The statement drew strong condemnation from Yoshihide Suga, who described the speech as \"extremely provocative and egregious\". The next day, an IRBM was fired from near Pyongyang and flew over Hokkaido, Japan before splashing down in the western Pacific about two thousand kilometers off Cape Erimo at about 7:16 AM local time.\n\nThe missile traveled 3,700 kilometres (2,300 mi) achieving a maximum apogee of 770 kilometres (480 mi) during its 19 minute flight. It is the furthest any North Korean IRBM missile has gone above and beyond Japan.  On 18 September, North Korea announced that any further sanctions would only cause acceleration of their nuclear program.\n\nU.S. and China agree on ″pressure″\nOn 18 September, the White House said president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping had discussed North Korea’s continued nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests and committed to “maximising pressure on North Korea through vigorous enforcement” of UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea; North Korea said the sanctions would accelerate its nuclear programme.", "date": "2017-09-22"}}

Many people from underdeveloped African countries embark on the dangerous journey for Europe, in hopes of a better life. In parts of Africa, particularly Mauritania and Morocco, trafficking of immigrants to Europe has become more lucrative than drug trafficking. Some migrants die during the journey. Most of those whose claim for asylum were unsuccessful are deported back to Africa. Libya is the major departure point for irregular migrants setting off for Europe.\n\nBetween October 2013 and October 2014, the Italian government ran Operation Mare Nostrum, a naval and air operation intended to reduce irregular immigration to Europe and the incidence of migratory ship wreckages off the coast of Lampedusa. The Italian government ceased the operation as it was judged to be unsustainable, involving a large proportion of the Italian navy. The operation was replaced by a more limited joint EU border protection operation, named Operation Triton managed by the EU border agency, Frontex. Some other European governments, including Britain's, argued that the operations such as Mare Nostrum and Triton serve to provide an \"unintended pull factor\" encouraging further migration.\n\nIn 2014, 170,100 irregular migrants were recorded arriving in Italy by sea (an increase from 42,925 arrivals recorded in 2013), 141,484 of them leaving from Libya. Most of them came from Syria, the Horn of Africa and West Africa.\n\nThe issue returned to international headlines with a series of migrant shipwrecks, part of the 2015 Mediterranean migration crisis. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates suggest that between the start of 2015 and the middle of April, 21,000 migrants had reached the Italian coast and 900 migrants had died in the Mediterranean. Critics of European policy towards irregular migration in the Mediterranean argue that the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum failed to deter migrants and that its replacement with Triton \"created the conditions for the higher death toll.\"", "date": "2018-10-22"}}
